What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Remembering the commands and how to type them.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How the git branches function.  Also a bit more about how a "proper" GitWorkflow is supposed to work.  And I definitely think we got to see some potential pitfalls of GitWorkflow.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Lots.  Can't remember them all.  Mostly for clarification of branch structure and how various activities interacting with it interrelate.
What still confuses you about Git?
The master branch.  Also, when you have a merge conflict, I get how to resolve the conflict.  But once you save the conflicting files does it matter which branch you commit to?
How was our first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Good, I still am learning technological communication include basic social media skills so that is adding an extra stress layer.  While navigating I found it overwhelming to try and read the instructions and give good helpful advice and keep track of what my partner was typing, and think at the same time.  I definitely need to pre-read the task so I know at least one of those things coming in.  Driving I found much easier, cause I could focus on doing and understanding what I'm doing.
