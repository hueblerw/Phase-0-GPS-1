#Reflect questions

*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? Remembering the commands. Also committing and pushing.
*What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Git Fetch and Git Merge as they are apart of Git Pull
*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
*What still confuses you about Git? What to do after resolving a merge conflict, do we commit the merge or the feature branch? 
*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? It was very helpful and I liked it a lot! Katy helped us through our many questions that we had and would give great explanations to areas we had trouble in. William definitely helped on spots we were stuck on and communicated effectively! We were able to discuss and get out of some issues that had come up.
